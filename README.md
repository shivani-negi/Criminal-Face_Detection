# bit2byte++ presents: Criminal Face Detector
Guys, check this project is live and crazy.
We're bringing the world of tech and security investigation like never ever before!

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
There is no information on criminal face detection in India, despite the fact that it is a developing nation. However, by using these face detection projects, the police of our nation can more easily identify criminals in any challenging situation by matching the criminal's face to one in their criminal database by removing complexity or by matching the victim's face dimensions. Therefore, we simplify the image before comparing it to the criminal database; if the information fits an already-existing record, it will be highly beneficial.

SOLUTION:
In today’s world, face recognition is an important part for the purpose of security and surveillance. Hence there is a need for an efficient and cost effective system.
The face recognition is able to recognize the face and able to send notification to a user when an unknown being has been detected through IoT.
Upon detecting the face, the controller enables the camera for capturing the event and alerts the user by placing the live video of that event on webpage.

CRMINAL NOT DETECTED:
When the known image in our database or record is not matched with the human in the camera, it will then detect that the criminal not matched
